##Tasks in the assignment

There are 3 and a bit parts to the assignment:

## Part 1
Driving Forward 15 black tiles.
Description: Drive forward counting 15 black tiles.
Emit a 'distinctive' sound every time a tile is passed.
Turn the body ninety degrease right.

Assigned to: H Paterson

Status: Initial code available, but untested.


##Part 2:
Drive forward for 7 big white tiles and put the bot in contact with the tower.
Using any combination of sonar, touch, & camera sensors, and dead reckoning to locate the tower.
Course changes, if necessary to put the bot in , could be made during the driving or after advancing to locate the tower.

##Part 3:
Push the block off the square it's located on.
Make a sound to indicate completion.

Assigned to:

Status:


##Part (4):
Encapsulate the motor, and sensors.
Add ease-of-use functions to drive the bot forward/turn the body n degrees with a single function call.
Add a demon around the optical sensor to average the recent data for use.
Otherwise make high level wrappers around the EV3 API for ease-of-use.

Assigned to: H Paterson

Status: V2 tested and working as documented.
We may also want to wrap the sonar into a search algorithm, depending how we implement the approach to the tower.



I suggest we each take responsibility for programming one part. We can help each other by sharing code and
ideas as we encounter issues with out parts.
