###This file is used to record the results of bot testing.
Because we won't usually be able to test on a bot immediately, I suggest we write our code
assuming it will work, and I (or anyone else with time) can go to the labs from time to time to test our
code on a bot and fix bugs as they're found.

We can also note the outcome of testing here so what we all know what we have to work on:
-------------------------------------TESTING OUTCOMES---------------------------------------

If you find a non-trivial semantic bug in code someone else wrote, you should check with them what it's
supposed to do, and probably let them fix it unless an obvious fix presents itself.

Sample report:

##Bug in README.md, line 14(?)
# Line 14 on the readme contains misspellings.
[Description of the bug. Expected and actual behaviour. Suggested changes?]
#Discuttion:
H Paterson - Yeah, I'm a idot and can't spell. I'll fix it.
A Person - Good riddance.
H Paterson - All done. We can delete this bug now.
