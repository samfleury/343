phase_two.py
phase_two manages the second phase of the operation, approaching the tower.

phase_two can use and combination of the sensors available to locate the tower,
as well as dead reckoning - the tower (should) be seven large tiles directly
in front of the bot.

The sonar and bump sensors are suggested by the assessment specifications.

If you use the optical sensor to count tiles as you navigate, allow for the
bot's passage over the small (light and dark) tiles.

approach_tower() drives the bot forward over seven large tiles, and searches for
the plastic tower.

approach_tower will return control when the bot is stopped, and in contact with 
the tower, ready for phase three to begin
