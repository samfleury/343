You're crying. This is horrible! I care! Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her. She's really gotten to you, hasn't she? I don't know what's happening to me. Simple.

Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop. Elaine, there's much you don't understand about the Jewish religion. For example, did you know that rabbis are allowed to date? (About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...? You know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in Myrtle Beach. Perhaps, if you're not too busy, we could wing on down after the High Holidays? Elaine? 'Lainie? So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me. Yikes.
