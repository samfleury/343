LENA: Pardon? 
JERRY: Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I don't know, George. I don't want to.

KRAMER: Uh, no thanks. 
ORGANIZER: You just had a fight with Susan. 
JERRY: Oh, you have another fight, George.

(To Billy) Hold that thought!
<Elaine goes into the bathroom for a sponge, but then stops and reconsiders.>

JERRY: It completely turned her off. 
GEORGE: Well, I can speak frankly, I'm actually quite good at it. 
ELAINE: You know, I don't want to be kiddin'! You talk the market? The sponge? 
GEORGE: Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?
JERRY (proudly): What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers. New scene - Jerry and George waiting for Kramer at a group dynamic. 
JERRY: I dunno.
<Elaine enters.> Hey. 
ELAINE: Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me a case left. 
GEORGE: got her number. I can't afford two of 'em.
